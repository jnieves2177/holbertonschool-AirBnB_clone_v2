# Holberton Python Web Flask Project

## What is a Web Framework?
A web framework is a software framework designed to aid the development of web applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs. It provides a structure for building and organizing code, as well as tools and libraries for common tasks in web development. Web frameworks aim to simplify and streamline the process of creating web applications by providing pre-built components and enforcing best practices.

## How to build a web framework with Flask:

    Install Flask:
    Make sure Flask is installed in your Python environment using pip install Flask.

    Project Structure:
    Organize your project into folders like /static for static files and /templates for HTML templates. The main application file (app.py) will be in the root directory.

    Create the Flask App:
    In the app.py file, create a basic Flask application, define routes using decorators like @app.route('/'), and handle the routes by defining corresponding functions.

    Run the App:
    Execute your application (python app.py) and check if it runs successfully.

    Expand the Framework:
    Build upon the basic structure by adding features such as more routes, static file serving, and template rendering. Continue adding functionalities based on your project requirements.

    Add Templates:
    Create HTML templates in the templates folder and render them in your routes using render_template from Flask.

    Add More Features:
    Continue expanding your framework by incorporating advanced features such as request handling, form handling, database integration, and more.

## How to define routes in Flask:
Use the @app.route() decorator to associate functions with specific URLs.

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, this is the home page!'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'This is the about page.'

## What is a route:

 In Flask, a route is a URL pattern associated with a specific function in your Python code. When a user accesses a particular URL, the associated function, also known as a view function, is 
 executed. Routes are defined using the @app.route() decorator in Flask, where app is an instance of the Flask class. 

## How to handle variables in a route:

In Flask, you can handle variables in a route by using variable rules. Variable rules allow you to capture values from the URL and pass them as arguments to the associated view function. This enables you to create dynamic routes that respond to different inputs.

## What is a template:

In web development, a template refers to a file or a set of files that are used to define the structure and layout of a web page. Templates are typically written in a templating language and contain placeholders that are later replaced with actual content. The primary purpose of templates is to separate the structure of a web page from its dynamic content, allowing for more maintainable and modular code.
